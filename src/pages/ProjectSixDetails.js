<p>Full Stack / Front End Developer with TV news background <span role="img" alt="" aria-label="Clapperboard">ðŸŽ¬</span></p>
<p>{`I'm a full stack developer, a recent graduate of the Makers bootcamp in
London and work for Channel 4 News.`}  </p>
<p>{`I'm particularly excited about front end work, especially building beautiful,
user-friendly apps and immersive scrollytelling pages. I love it when
something small I've built elicits reactions of wonder from those I demo it to!
For example, I've recently built and deployed websites with birthday greetings
for friends and family instead of cards - exciting to receive, and great for the
environment too.`}  </p>
<p>{`I want to put my programming skills to use for the benefit of our planet,
and see endless possibilities for this. I'm a tree-hugging vegan, and member of
my company's Sustainability Forum, where we work to reduce carbon footprint.`}  </p>
<p>{`I also want to demystify programming for those who aren't normally
drawn into it as a career, especially girls. I got into programming myself
thanks to a RailsGirls workshop, and have been coding with my daughter on
Sphero Edu and Scratch.`}  </p>
<p>{`Inclusive design fascinates me and I want to become good at it - I knew
the issues but Chimmy Kalu's talk at this year's Women Driven Development
conference was an eye-opener for me.`}  </p>
